# past-projects
A collection of scripts, reports and CAD files from previous projects.

## automated-rover

Really fun project I worked on with a friend to create an autonymous 'bomb disposal' rover to enter a competition. The rover would locate an infra-red source, read some information off an RFID chip and return back to base, displaying the information on an LED display. Used a PIC microcontroller and Embedded-C.

FYI... we won. 


## headband-controller

A charity project I worked on to design a headband that could help someone with muscular disabilities to control their computer using their eyebrow movements only. Included designing the headband and circuitry, creating the firmware to connect mechanomyographyic sensors to a microcontroller inside the headband and creating some software so the signals picked up by the sensors could be picked up on a laptop.   


## university-reports

Three reports showcasing my engineering skills in the fields of design (Corkscrew Design Project), mechanical transmissions (Yacht Transmission Report) and the full design, manufacture and testing process (Space Manipulator Report).


## MATLAB

A collection of some scripts I created in MATLAB, mostly they produce plots of well known functions (eg, Rastringin's function) and also creating some genetic algorithms.
